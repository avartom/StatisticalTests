# Statistical Tests

Anyone who is a fan of detective TV shows has watched a scene where human remains are discovered and some sort of expert is called in to determine when the person died. But is this science fiction or science fact? Is it possible to use evidence from skeletal remains to determine how long a body has been buried (a decent approximation of how long the person has been dead)?

Researchers sampled long bone material from bodies exhumed from coffin burials in two cemeteries in England. In each case, date of death and burial (and therefore interment time) was known. This data is given in the Longbones.csv dataset which you can find here.
